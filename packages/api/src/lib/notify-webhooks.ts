// You guys both wanted webhooks to let you know when the map data is updated, right? I now have that functional, but will need your hardcoded webhook urls. Can you share those with me? In the future Iâ€™ll allow them to be dynamic but for now was hoping to doing something light. It will just send a post or get (whichever you want) whenever the data changes. I will likely send a payload like this:
// {
// eventId?: number,
// locationId?: number,
// orgId?: number
// }
// where all 3 might be updated or undefined

interface Webhook {
  url: string;
  method: "POST" | "GET";
}

const webhooks: Webhook[] = [
  // {
  //   url: "https://58898a233cdb.ngrok.app/api/trpc/ping",
  //   method: "GET",
  // },
];

export const notifyWebhooks = async (data?: unknown) => {
  for (const webhook of webhooks) {
    if (webhook.method === "POST") {
      await axios.post(webhook.url, data, {
        method: webhook.method,
      });
    } else if (webhook.method === "GET") {
      await axios.get(webhook.url, {
        method: webhook.method,
      });
    }
  }
};
